We propose an automatic design method for semantic segmentation models based on a restricted search space and improved GA, named Evolvable Architecture Search CNN (EAS-CNN), to optimize the network both in terms of module structure 

The training and testing code can refer to GeoSeg(https://github.com/WangLibo1995/GeoSeg).
